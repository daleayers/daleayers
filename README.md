- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @daleayers
- This project uses C++ to call Python functions. First it will read a text document and return a key pair depending on how many times every string was in the text document. For example if eggs were in the document three times and milk was in there two times it would return eggs 3, milk 2 ect. The second option allows you to search for a specific item, and the third option will allow you to create a "graph" that will convert the numbers in the key value to *'s. 

The major difficulty in this project was identifying errors in the Python code. If there was any kind of error visual studio would throw exemptions that would lead you down rabbit holes that made no sense. 

Improvements that I would make are finding a way to make the graph on option three just look more clean and 'graph' like. Right now its pretty simple I bet there are some interesting ways out there to return more readable graphs. 

The biggest skill I picked up from this project was debugging. I learned that this is a skill just like anything else in programming. Trying to find exactly where a piece of code went wrong can be challenging, I would like to maybe develope a 'best practice' for myself that I can follow in the future.
